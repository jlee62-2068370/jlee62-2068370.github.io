            <p>Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?<br>
                Thou art more lovely and more temperate:<br>
                Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br>
                And summer’s lease hath all too short a date;<br>
                Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,<br>
                And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;<br>
                And every fair from fair sometime declines,</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-two">
            <p>
                By chance or nature’s changing course untrimm'd;<br>
                But thy eternal summer shall not fade,<br>
                Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;<br>
                Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,<br>
                When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st:<br>
                So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,<br>
                So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.<br>
